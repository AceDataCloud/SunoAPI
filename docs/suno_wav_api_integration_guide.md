# Suno Wav API Integration Instructions

SUNO allows us to obtain music in wav format files. This document explains the integration methods for the related API.

The core input parameter for this API is `audio_id`, which is the song ID generated by the official source; it also optionally supports `callback_url` for asynchronous callback addresses.

The `audio_id` we input here is `ec13e502-d043-4eb2-92ee-e900c6da69d1`.

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.acedata.cloud/suno/wav"

headers = {
    "accept": "application/json",
    "authorization": "Bearer aa287fa4cc54401087a9fab3f99630af",
    "content-type": "application/json"
}

payload = {
    "audio_id": "ec13e502-d043-4eb2-92ee-e900c6da69d1"
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(response.text)
```

The result is as follows:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "task_id": "19787138-49e9-413a-8611-156c375aa99f",
  "trace_id": "ec232cf9-8b75-42df-a8a3-fe6d7d6fd02e",
  "data": [
    {
      "file_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/ec13e502-d043-4eb2-92ee-e900c6da69d1.wav"
    }
  ]
}
```

As we can see, the `file_url` field in `data` is the wav format file of the music obtained, which is a publicly accessible CDN address and supports the mp3 suffix.
