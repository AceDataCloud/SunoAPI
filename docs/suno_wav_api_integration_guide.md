# Suno Wav API Integration Instructions

SUNO allows us to obtain music in wav format. This document explains the integration method for the related API.

This API has only one input parameter, which is `audio_id`, the song ID generated by the official source.

The `audio_id` we are using here is `ec13e502-d043-4eb2-92ee-e900c6da69d1`.

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.acedata.cloud/suno/wav"

headers = {
    "accept": "application/json",
    "authorization": "Bearer aa287fa4cc54401087a9fab3f99630af",
    "content-type": "application/json"
}

payload = {
    "audio_id": "ec13e502-d043-4eb2-92ee-e900c6da69d1"
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(response.text)
```

The result is as follows:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "task_id": "19787138-49e9-413a-8611-156c375aa99f",
  "trace_id": "ec232cf9-8b75-42df-a8a3-fe6d7d6fd02e",
  "data": [
    {
      "file_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/ec13e502-d043-4eb2-92ee-e900c6da69d1.wav"
    }
  ]
}
```

As can be seen, the `file_url` field in `data` is the wav format file of the music obtained, which is a publicly accessible CDN address that supports the mp3 suffix.
