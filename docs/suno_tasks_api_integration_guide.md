# Integration and Use of Suno Tasks API

The main function of the Suno Tasks API is to query the execution status of a task by inputting the task ID generated by the Suno Audios Generation API or Suno Lyrics Generation API.

This document will provide detailed integration instructions for the Suno Tasks API, helping you easily integrate and fully utilize the powerful features of this API. With the Suno Tasks API, you can easily query the execution status of tasks from the Suno Lyrics Generation API or Suno Audios Generation API.

## Application Process

To use the Suno Tasks API, you first need to apply for the corresponding service on the application page [Suno Audios Generation API](https://platform.acedata.cloud/documents/4da95d9d-7722-4a72-857d-bf6be86036e9), and then copy the task ID from the Suno Audios Generation API, as shown in the image:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/bc6754.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

Finally, go to the Tasks API page [Suno Tasks API](https://platform.acedata.cloud/documents/b0dd9823-0e01-4c75-af83-5a6e2e05bfed) to apply for the corresponding service. After entering the page, click the "Acquire" button, as shown in the image:

![Application Page](https://cdn.acedata.cloud/rci31i.png)

If you are not logged in or registered, you will be automatically redirected to the [login page](https://platform.acedata.cloud) inviting you to register and log in. After logging in or registering, you will be automatically returned to the current page.

There is a free quota available for first-time applicants, allowing you to use the API for free.

## Request Example

The Suno Tasks API can be used to query the results of both the Suno Audios Generation API and the Suno Lyrics Generation API. For information on how to use the Suno Audios Generation API, please refer to the document [Suno Audios Generation API](https://platform.acedata.cloud/documents/d016ee3f-421b-4b6e-989a-8beba8701701). For information on how to use the Suno Lyrics Generation API, please refer to [Suno Lyrics Generation API](https://platform.acedata.cloud/documents/f1c66741-a488-43ca-91fc-e53fbbda639a).

We will take a task ID returned by the Suno Audios Generation API as an example to demonstrate how to use this API. Suppose we have a task ID: eae26f89-b64b-404d-a80c-761996660b1c, and we will demonstrate how to pass in a task ID.

The response contains multiple fields, the request field is the request body when initiating the task, while the response field is the response body returned after the task is completed. The field descriptions are as follows.

- `id`, the ID of the song generation task, used to uniquely identify this song generation task.
- `request`, the request information in the song task.
- `response`, the return information in the song task.

## Batch Query Operation

This is for querying the details of multiple task IDs, and unlike above, the action needs to be selected as retrieve_batch.

**Request Body** includes:

- `ids`: An array of uploaded task IDs.
- `action`: The operation method for the task.

The return result contains multiple fields, where items include the specific details of the batch song tasks, and each song task's specific information is the same as the fields in the previous single task return result.

- `items`, all specific details of the batch song tasks. It is an array, and each element of the array has the same format as the previous query for a single task return result.
- `count`, the number of song tasks in this batch query.

#### CURL

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.acedata.cloud/suno/tasks' \
-H 'accept: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {token}' \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \

```

#### Python

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.acedata.cloud/suno/tasks"

headers = {
    "accept": "application/json",
    "authorization": "Bearer {token}",
    "content-type": "application/json"
}

payload = {

    "action": "retrieve_batch"
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(response.text)
```

## Error Handling

When calling the API, if an error occurs, the API will return the corresponding error code and message. For example:

- `400 token_mismatched`: Bad request, possibly due to missing or invalid parameters.
- `400 api_not_implemented`: Bad request, possibly due to missing or invalid parameters.
- `401 invalid_token`: Unauthorized, invalid or missing authorization token.
- `429 too_many_requests`: Too many requests, you have exceeded the rate limit.
- `500 api_error`: Internal server error, something went wrong on the server.

### Error Response Example

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "api_error",
    "message": "fetch failed"
  },
  "trace_id": "2cf86e86-22a4-46e1-ac2f-032c0f2a4e89"
}
```

## Conclusion

Through this document, you have learned how to use the Suno Tasks API to query the specific details of single or batch song tasks. We hope this document helps you better integrate and use the API. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact our technical support team.
